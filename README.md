# Sumo_Bot
Sumo bot program that runs on an Arduino on an ELEGOO Smart Robot Car
This is Arduino code written for an ELEGOO Smart Robot Car that has been modified to function as a sumo bot. 
The goal of the bot is to use the infrared sensors to stay on the mat while finding the oponent with the ultrasonic sensors afterwhich it will try to push it off the mat.

It includes the SR04.h Library for the ultrasonic sensor, and this can be found here: https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/HC-SR04
